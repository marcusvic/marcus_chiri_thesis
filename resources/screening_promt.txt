There are 2 ways of analysing policy implementation performance. Some papers analyse which factors caused the policy implementation performance (these are type A papers), and other papers analyse which effects a specific factor had in policy implementation performance (these are type B papers). We only want to analyse type A papers. Please exclude papers that focus solely on the effect of one particular variable on the outcome. You are receiving a list containing a paper's id, title and abstract. Output if the paper should be analysed or not (should_be_analysed), your confidence level between 0 and 1 in making this choice (confidence_level), and a very brief summary of why you made this choice (summary).
